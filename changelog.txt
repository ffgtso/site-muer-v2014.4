	* Reworked setup/config mode to suit FFGT
	  - LAN is supposed to be on DHCP client mode
	  - Node send signals to FFGT servers
	  - Request to http://setup.guetersloh.freifunk.net should redirect to local setup interface
	  - Geolocation is done by FFGT servers on behalf of node, using standard techniques
